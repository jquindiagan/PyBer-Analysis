# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to compare and summarize ride-sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, rural).

## Results

### Differences in Ride-Sharing Data

- **Totals and Averages**

    If we look at the table below, we see that the total rides, drivers, and fares increase from rural to urban areas. There are 13 times more rides in urban areas than there are in rural areas.
    We can also see a negative correlation between average fares and total rides and drivers; less drivers and rides will result in higher average fares per driver and per ride.
